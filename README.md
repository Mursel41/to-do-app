# Single Page Application - Todo App

This repo hosts a series of workshops on creating a single page application using React. The workshops are following DCI's curriculum structure. During this project we will use the official [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) of React as our basic reference. Also this [article](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) is a nice way to get started with react. Please bookmark both links for future reference. :crystal_ball:

## The way it works

This repo has several branches with several stages of the development of the final app. For each stage, a list of changes will be added to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file, to explain the changes made.

If you need a reminder on how this app changed through each of the workshops, simply checkout the branch for the phase you are interested in, and read the changelog.

In addition, branches with the prefix task/ describe the task that needs to be achieved in that change. The tasks are all listed in the TASKS.md file. If you want to start doing things yourself, simply checkout the task branch and make the change. To begin from the start, checkout the task/01-mock-database-and-controllers branch.

## The following is part of the readme.md of the create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
